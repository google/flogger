   * API for determining the logging class and log statement sites, return from {@link
   * #getCallerFinder}. This classes is immutable and thread safe.
   *
   * <p>This functionality is not provided directly by the {@code Platform} API because doing so
   * would require several additional levels to be added to the stack before the implementation was
   * reached. This is problematic for Android which has only limited stack analysis. By allowing
   * callers to resolve the implementation early and then call an instance directly (this is not an
   * interface), we reduce the number of elements in the stack before the caller is found.
   *
   * <h2>Essential Implementation Restrictions</h2>
   *
   * Any implementation of this API <em>MUST</em> follow the rules listed below to avoid any risk of
   * re-entrant code calling during logger initialization. Failure to do so risks creating complex,
   * hard to debug, issues with Flogger configuration.
   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>Implementations <em>MUST NOT</em> attempt any logging in static methods or constructors.
   *   <li>Implementations <em>MUST NOT</em> statically depend on any unknown code.
   *   <li>Implementations <em>MUST NOT</em> depend on any unknown code in constructors.
   * </ol>
   *
   * <p>Note that logging and calling arbitrary unknown code (which might log) are permitted inside
   * the instance methods of this API, since they are not called during platform initialization. The
   * easiest way to achieve this is to simply avoid having any non-trivial static fields or any
   * instance fields at all in the implementation.
   *
   * <p>While this sounds onerous it's not difficult to achieve because this API is a singleton, and
   * can delay any actual work until its methods are called. For example if any additional state is
   * required in the implementation, it can be held via a "lazy holder" to defer initialization.
