/**
 * A user facing API for creating and modifying scoped logging contexts in applications.
 *
 * <p>Scoped contexts provide a way for application code to attach metadata and control the
 * behaviour of logging within well defined scopes. This is most often associated with making "per
 * request" modifications to logging behaviour such as:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Adding a request ID to every log statement.
 *   <li>Forcing logging at a finer level for a specific request (e.g. based on a URL debug
 *       parameter).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Scopes are nestable and new scopes can be added to provide additional metadata which will
 * be available to logging as long as the scope is installed.
 *
 * <p>Note that in the current API scopes are also modifiable after creation, but this usage is
 * discouraged and may be removed in future. The problem with modifying scopes after creation is
 * that, since scopes can be shared between threads, it is potentially confusing if tags are added
 * to a scope when it is being used concurrently by multiple threads.
 *
 * <p>Note that since logging contexts are designed to be modified by code in libraries and helper
 * functions which do not know about each other, the data structures and behaviour of logging
 * contexts are carefully designed to avoid any accidental "undoing" of existing behaviour. In
 * particular:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Tags can only be added to scopes, never modified or removed.
 *   <li>Logging that's enabled by one scope cannot be disabled from within a nested scope.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>One possibly surprising result of this behaviour is that it's not possible to disable logging
 * from within a scope. However this is quite intentional, since overly verbose logging should be
 * fixed by other mechanisms (code changes, global logging configuration), and not on a "per
 * request" basis.
 *
 * <p>Depending on the framework used, it's possible that the current logging scope will be
 * automatically propagated to some or all threads or sub-tasks started from within the scope. This
 * is not guaranteed however and the semantic behaviour of scope propagation is not defined by this
 * class.
 *
 * <p>Context support and automatic propagation is heavily reliant on Java platform capabilities,
 * and precise behaviour is likely to differ between runtime environments or frameworks. Context
 * propagation may not behave the same everywhere, and in some situations logging contexts may not
 * be supported at all. Methods which attempt to affect context state may do nothing in some
 * environments, or when called at some points in an application. If application code relies on
 * modifications to an existing, implicit logging context, it should always check the return values
 * of any modification methods called (e.g. {@link #addTags(Tags)}).
