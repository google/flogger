/**
 * A sequence of metadata key/value pairs which can be associated to a log statement, either
 * directly via methods in the fluent API, of as part of a scoped logging context.
 *
 * <p>Metadata keys can "single valued" or "repeating" based on {@link MetadataKey#canRepeat}, but
 * it is permitted for a {@code Metadata} implementation to retain multiple single valued keys, and
 * in that situation the key at the largest index is the one which should be used.
 *
 * <p>Multiple {@code Metadata} instances can be merged, in order, to provide a final sequence for
 * a log statement. When {@code Metadata} instance are merged, the result is just the concatenation
 * of the sequence of key/value pairs, and this is what results in the potential for mutliple single
 * valued keys to exist.
 *
 * <p>If the value of a single valued key is required, the {@link #findValue(MetadataKey)} method
 * should be used to look it up. For all other metadata processing, a {@link MetadataProcessor}
 * should be created to ensure that scope and log site metadata can be merged correctly.
