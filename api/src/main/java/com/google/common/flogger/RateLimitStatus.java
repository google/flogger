/**
 * Status for rate limiting operations, usable by rate limiters and available to subclasses of
 * {@code LogContext} to handle rate limiting consistently.
 *
 * <h2>Design Notes</h2>
 *
 * <p>The purpose of this class is to allow rate limiters to behave in a way which is consistent
 * when multiple rate limiters are combined for a single log statement. If you are writing a rate
 * limiter for Flogger which you want to "play well" with other rate limiters, it is essential that
 * you understand how {@code RateLimitStatus} is designed to work.
 *
 * <p>Firstly, {@code LogContext} tracks a single status for each log statement reached. This is
 * modified by code in the {@code postProcess()} method (which can be overridden by custom logger
 * implementations).
 *
 * <p>When a rate limiter is used, it returns a {@code RateLimitStatus}, which is combined with the
 * existing value held in the context:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * rateLimitStatus = RateLimitStatus.combine(rateLimitStatus, MyCustomRateLimiter.check(...));
 * }>/pre>
 *
 * <p>A rate limiter should switch between two primary states "limiting" and "pending":
 * <ul>
 * <li>In the "limiting" state, the limiter should return the {@link RateLimitStatus#DISALLOW} value
 * and update any internal state until it reaches its trigger condition. Once the trigger condition
 * is reached, the limiter enters the "pending" state.
 * <li>In the "pending" state, the limiter returns an "allow" status <em>until it is
 * {@link RateLimitStatus#reset()}</em>.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This two-step approach means that, when multiple rate limiters are active for a single log
 * statement, logging occurs after all rate limiters are "pending" (and at this point they are all
 * reset). This is much more consistent than having each rate limiter operate independently, and
 * allows a much more intuitive understanding of expected behaviour.
 *
 * <p>It is recommended that most rate limiters should start in the "pending" state to ensure that
 * the first log statement they process is emitted (even when multiple rate limiters are used). This
 * isn't required, but it should be documented either way.
 *
 * <p>Each rate limiter is expected to follow this basic structure:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * final class CustomRateLimiter extends RateLimitStatus {
 *   private static final LogSiteMap<CustomRateLimiter> map =
 *       new LogSiteMap<CustomRateLimiter>() {
 *         @Override protected CustomRateLimiter initialValue() {
 *           return new CustomRateLimiter();
 *         }
 *       };
 *
 *  static RateLimitStatus check(Metadata metadata, LogSiteKey logSiteKey, ...) {
 *    MyRateLimitData rateLimitData = metadata.findValue(MY_CUSTOM_KEY);
 *    if (rateLimitData == null) {
 *      return null;
 *    }
 *    return map.get(logSiteKey, metadata).checkRateLimit(rateLimitData, ...);
 *  }
 *
 *  RateLimitStatus checkRateLimit(MyRateLimitData rateLimitData, ...) {
 *    <update internal state>
 *    return <is-pending> ? this : DISALLOW;
 *  }
 *
 *   @Override
 *   public void reset() {
 *     <reset from "pending" to "limiting" state>
 *   }
 * }
 * }>/pre>
 *
 * <p>The use of {@code LogLevelMap} ensures a rate limiter instance is held separately for each log
 * statement, but it also handles complex garbage collection issues around "specialized" log site
 * keys. All rate limiter implementations <em>MUST</em> use this approach.
 *
 * <p>Having the rate limiter class extend {@code RateLimitStatus} is a convenience for the case
 * where the {@code reset()} operation requires no additional information. If the {@code reset()}
 * operation requires extra state (e.g. from previous logging calls) then this approach will not be
 * possible, and a separate {@code RateLimitStatus} subclass would need to be allocated to hold that
 * state.
 *
 * <p>Rate limiter instances <em>MUST</em> be thread safe, and should avoid using locks wherever
 * possible (since using explicit locking can cause unacceptable thread contention in highly
 * concurrent systems).
