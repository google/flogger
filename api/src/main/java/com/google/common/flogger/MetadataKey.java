/**
 * Key for logging semi-structured metadata values.
 *
 * <p>Metadata keys can be used to provide log statements with strongly typed values which can be
 * read and interpreted by logging backends or other logs related tools. This mechanism is intended
 * for values with specific semantics and should not be seen as a replacement for logging arguments
 * as part of a formatted log message.
 *
 * <p>Examples of where using {@code MetadataKey} is suitable are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Logging a value with special semantics (e.g. values that are handled specially by the
 *       logger backend).
 *   <li>Passing configuration to a specific logger backend to modify behaviour for individual log
 *       statements or all log statements in a {@code ScopedLoggingContext}.
 *   <li>Logging a structured value in many places with consistent formatting (e.g. so it can later
 *       be re-parsed by logs related tools).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If you just want to log a general "key value pair" in a small number of log statements, it is
 * still better to just do something like {@code log("key=%s", value)}.
 *
 * <p>Metadata keys are expected to be singleton constants, and should never be allocated at the log
 * site itself. Even though they are expected to be singletons, comparing keys should be done via
 * {@code equals()} (rather than '==') since this will be safe in cases where non-singleton keys
 * exist, and is just as fast if the keys are singletons.
 *
 * <p>It is strongly recommended that any public {@link MetadataKey} instances are defined as {@code
 * public static final} fields in a top-level or nested class which does no logging. Ideally a
 * separate class would be defined to hold only the keys, since this allows keys to be loaded very
 * early in the logging {@link Platform} lifecycle without risking any static initialization issues.
 *
 * <p>Custom subclasses of {@code MetadataKey} which override either of the protected {@link #emit}
 * methods should take care to avoid calling any code which might trigger logging since this could
 * lead to unexpected recursion, especially if the key is being logged as part of a {@code
 * ScopedLoggingContext}. While there is protection against unbounded reentrant logging in Flogger,
 * it is still best practice to avoid it where possible.
 *
 * <p>Metadata keys are passed to a log statement via the {@code with()} method, so it can aid
 * readability to choose a name for the constant field which reads "fluently" as part of the log
 * statement. For example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Prefer this...
 * logger.atInfo().with(FILE_LOGGING_FOR, user).log("User specific log message...");
 * // to...
 * logger.atInfo().with(SET_LOGGING_TO_USER_FILE, user).log("User specific log message...");
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Logger backends can act upon metadata present in log statements to modify behaviour. Any
 * metadata entries that are not handled by a backend explicitly are, by default, rendered as part
 * of the log statement in a default format.
 *
 * <p>Note that some metadata entries are handled prior to being processed by the backend (e.g. rate
 * limiting), but a metadata entry remains present to record the fact that rate limiting was
 * enabled.

   *   <li>Allocating non-trivial amounts of memory (e.g. recording values in an unbounded data
   *       structure).
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>If you do implement a {@code MetadataKey} with non-trivial value processing, you should
   * always make it very clear in the documentation that the key may not be suitable for widespread
   * use.

   * <p>By default this method just calls {@code out.handle(getLabel(), value)}.
